                in school that make a child talented, but a different way of

                in education. Our teachers are well trained to teach in the
                classroom, but they are also expected to have faith and trust in

                expectations. The school's mission is not only to pursue
                academic excellence, but also to motivate and empower its
                students to be lifelong learners, critical thinkers and
                productive members of a dynamic global society . School run by
                the “RAHMANI PUBLIC SCHOOL” has earned its name and reputation
                by providing excellent education for over 7 years. Within our
                group of institutions, we provide an atmosphere of multifaceted
                development where children are encouraged to channel their
                potential in pursuit of excellence . The school tries to do its
                best to in still strong values ​​in the children that are linked
                to learning and extracurricular activities. Making each
                individual an independent and self-sufficient citizen, the
                school offers a mix of curricular and co-curricular activities.
                While our main focus is on academic excellence, the school is
                also committed to preparing students for life, equipping them to
                meet the challenges of tomorrow and encouraging them to be
                socially relevant. We constantly strive to follow this ideology
                and instill it in everything we do to ensure that children are
                educated to their full potential, while we are constantly
                nurtured to pass as men and women qualified to bear
                responsibility in all walks of life. Parents are the strongest
                force to shape the future of children, and their constant
                support gives us the strength to do more and more. I thank them
